# Ecommerce cloud mini projects


# Repository Purpose


This repository provides ready-to-use mini projects, POVs, and MVP solutions focusing on e-commerce use cases. Cloud computing offers numerous benefits for e-commerce businesses, including scalability, high availability, cost optimization, high agility, and quick time to market. This repository provides practical examples of cloud-native solutions for common e-commerce use cases, such as order processing, inventory management, event-driven scenarios, payment processing, and many more.

The goal is to provide a reference infrastructure architecture for e-commerce businesses looking to migrate to cloud architectures or build new solutions on the cloud.

## E-Commerce Use Cases which are planned to be covered in this repository:

### 1. Serverless contact form

**Scenario:** \
The startup e-commerce website currently lacks an efficient way to handle customer inquiries.
When customers submit a contact form, the inquiries are not promptly addressed, leading to delayed responses and poor customer satisfaction. To improve this, the system needs to automatically send an email notification to the support team and also to the customer confirming the inquiry submission.


**Technical Requirement:** \
Implement a serverless contact form for an e-commerce website to collect customer inquiries. 
Host the form on a static website and process form submissions without server management.


**Solution Architecture:** \
AWS S3: For hosting the static website with the contact form. \
AWS API Gateway: To expose a REST API for form submissions. \
AWS Lambda: To process form submissions and send email notifications. \
Amazon SES: For sending email notifications to the support team and customers.

**Technical Implementation Plan:** \
Milestones and tasks: \
1. **Create an S3 bucket and host a static website.**
    - Create an S3 bucket using Terraform.
    - Configure the bucket for static website hosting using Terraform.
    - Upload the HTML/CSS/JavaScript files to the bucket along with test form.
    - Set the appropriate permissions for public access using Terraform.

2. **Create an API Gateway endpoint to receive form submissions.**
    - Create a new API in API Gateway using Terraform.
    - Define the resource and method for the contact form endpoint using Terraform.
    - Set up the integration with the Lambda function using Terraform.

3. **Create a Lambda function to process form submissions.**
    - Write the Lambda function code to handle form submissions.
    - Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for the Lambda function using Terraform.
    - Deploy the Lambda function and configure the environment variables using Terraform.

4. **Configure Amazon SES to send email notifications.**
    - Verify the domain in Amazon SES.
    - Set up DKIM and SPF for the domain.
    - Create email templates for notifications.
    - Update the Lambda function to send emails using Amazon SES.

5. **Test the contact form and email notifications.**
    - Submit test inquiries through the contact form.
    - Verify that the inquiries are processed correctly.
    - Check that email notifications are sent to the support team and customers.

6. **Deployment and monitoring.**
    - Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform.
    - Set up monitoring and logging for the Lambda function and API Gateway using Terraform.
    - Configure alerts for any errors or issues using Terraform.

7. **Best practices and tips.**
    - Follow security best practices for AWS resources.
    - Optimize the Lambda function for performance and cost.
    - Ensure the solution is scalable and maintainable.

8. **Documentation and references.**
    - Update the `README.md` with detailed instructions for installation and usage.
    - Provide a high-level implementation guide and best practices.
    - Include relevant links and references to support concept understanding.
